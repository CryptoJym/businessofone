interface Appointment {
  id: string;
  clientName: string;
  clientEmail: string;
  clientPhone?: string;
  date: Date;
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string;
  type: AppointmentType;

  dayOfWeek: number; // 0-6 (Sunday-Saturday)
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

## Configuration

3. **Time Selection**: User selects preferred date and time
4. **Information Form**: User fills out contact and business details
5. **Confirmation**: Success message with appointment details

## Styling & Branding

The calendar integration follows the Business of One design system:
- Primary color: Utlyze Blue (#4169E1)
- Accent color: Teal (#16A085)
- Clean, professional aesthetic
- Fully responsive design
- Accessibility considerations

## Future Enhancements

### API Integration Requirements

- Email service integration
- Calendar provider OAuth flows
- Database schema for persistent storage

## Development Notes

### Running the Application
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Access the calendar at: `http://localhost:3000/calendar`

### Testing Considerations
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for booking flow
- E2E tests for complete user journey
- Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)

## Conclusion
