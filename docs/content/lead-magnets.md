### Section 5: The Pricing Profit Calculator

**Discover Your True Hourly Rate (And How to Triple It)**

**Step 1: Calculate Your ACTUAL Hourly Rate**

Last month's total revenue: $______
Total hours worked: ______
Current hourly rate: $______ (Revenue ÷ Hours)

**Shocked? Most solos are earning 50% less than they think.**

**Step 2: Find Your Hidden Time Drains**

Track these often-forgotten hours:
- Email communication: ____ hours/week
- Scope creep: ____ hours/week
- Admin tasks: ____ hours/week
- Sales calls: ____ hours/week
- Revisions: ____ hours/week

Total hidden hours: ____ per week

**Step 3: Your True Project Profitability**

Average project fee: $______
Total project hours (including hidden): ______
True hourly rate: $______ 

**Step 4: The Profit Maximizer Formula**

Your new minimum project fee:
(Target hourly rate × Average project hours) × 1.3 = $______

The 1.3 multiplier covers:
- Scope creep buffer (10%)
- Admin time (10%)
- Profit margin (10%)

**Step 5: Value-Based Pricing Calculator**

Answer these questions:
1. What's the monetary value of your solution to the client? $______
2. How much time/money will you save them? $______
3. What's their budget range? $______

Your value-based price: 10-20% of total client value

**Example:**
- Client value: $100,000 (increased revenue from your work)
- Your fee: $10,000-20,000 (10-20% of value created)
- Compare to hourly: 50 hours × $200 = only $10,000

**Action Steps:**
1. Raise prices on all new projects by minimum 20%
2. Create packages instead of hourly pricing
3. Add rush delivery option at 50% premium
4. Eliminate your lowest-paying 20% of clients

### Section 6: Client Communication Scripts

**Script 1: The Boundary Setter**
*When clients contact you outside business hours*

"Hi [Name], thanks for reaching out! I maintain focused work hours to deliver my best results for all clients. I'll respond to this first thing [next business day]. If this is truly urgent, please [specific action/higher rate]."

**Script 2: The Price Defender**
*When clients push back on pricing*

"I understand price is an important factor. My rates reflect the [specific value/experience/results] I bring. I'm confident the ROI will exceed the investment. If budget is a concern, we could explore a phased approach or reduced scope. What would work better for you?"

**Script 3: The Scope Guardian**
*When clients ask for "just one more thing"*

"I'd be happy to add that! Since it's outside our original agreement, I can include it for an additional $[amount] and [time]. Alternatively, we could swap it for [existing deliverable] to stay within budget. Which do you prefer?"

**Script 4: The Payment Collector**
*When invoices go overdue*

"Hi [Name], I noticed invoice #[number] is now [days] overdue. I know things get busy! To avoid the late fee, please process payment by [date]. If there's an issue with the invoice, let me know so we can resolve it quickly."

**Script 5: The Project Closer**
*When prospects go silent*

"Hi [Name], I wanted to circle back on [project]. I'm scheduling my upcoming months and have [another client/project] interested in the same timeframe. Are you still planning to move forward? If not, no worries - I just want to plan accordingly."
