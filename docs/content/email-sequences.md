# Business of One - Email Sequences

## Welcome Series (5 Emails)

### Email 1: Welcome & Quick Win
**Subject**: Your Business of One journey starts now (+ a 10-minute win)
**Send**: Immediately

Hi [Name],

Welcome to Business of One! I'm thrilled you've taken the first step toward transforming your solo business.

I know you're busy (what solopreneur isn't?), so let's start with something you can implement in the next 10 minutes that will save you hours this week.

**The 10-Minute Email Template System**

1. Create a folder called "Email Templates"
2. Write templates for your 5 most common emails
3. Use text expansion software (TextExpander, PhraseExpress, or even Gmail templates)
4. Save 30+ minutes daily on repetitive emails

Simple? Yes. Effective? Absolutely. One client saved 12 hours in their first month with just this tip.

Tomorrow, I'll share why most solo businesses plateau (and how to break through).

To your solo success,
[Your Name]

### Email 2: The Solo Plateau Problem
**Subject**: Why 87% of solo businesses hit a ceiling
**Send**: Day 2

Hi [Name],

Yesterday you implemented your first time-saving system. How did it go?

Today, let's talk about the elephant in every solopreneur's room: The Revenue Plateau.

Here's what typically happens:
- Year 1: Hustle mode. Work all hours. Hit $50-100K.
- Year 2: More of the same. Maybe reach $150K.
- Year 3+: Burnout sets in. Revenue stalls. Something needs to change.

Sound familiar?

The problem isn't your work ethic. It's your systems (or lack thereof).

Multi-million dollar companies don't run on hustle. They run on systems. And that's exactly what you need â€“ just scaled for one.

**The System That Changed Everything**

Sarah Chen was stuck at $8K/month for two years. After implementing our Customer Success System, she hit $16K/month within 90 days. No new marketing. No hiring. Just better systems.

Tomorrow, I'll share the #1 system every solo business needs (hint: it's not what you think).

Systematically yours,
[Your Name]

P.S. Want Sarah's exact system? [Let's discuss it on a free strategy call].

### Email 3: The Multiplication Method
**Subject**: How to clone yourself (without hiring)
**Send**: Day 4

Hi [Name],

What if you could be in two places at once?

Better yet, what if you could handle 3x more clients without working more hours?

Meet The Multiplication Method â€“ the #1 system every solo business needs.

It's built on three pillars:

**1. Automation (Your Digital Team)**
- Scheduling: Calendly eliminates back-and-forth
- Invoicing: Automatic recurring billing
- Follow-ups: Sequences that nurture without you

**2. Documentation (Your Brain Backup)**
- SOPs for every process
- Video walkthroughs for complex tasks
- Checklists that ensure consistency

**3. Boundaries (Your Sanity Saver)**
- Office hours that clients respect
- Service packages (no more scope creep)
- "No" templates that preserve relationships

Marcus Rodriguez implemented this method and tripled his web development business while cutting his hours from 50 to 35 per week.

Want to see exactly how he did it? I've prepared a detailed case study just for you.

Multiplying your impact,
[Your Name]

P.S. In our next email, I'll reveal the pricing mistake that costs most solos $50K+ annually.

### Email 4: The $50K Pricing Mistake
**Subject**: The spreadsheet that found $50K
**Send**: Day 7

Hi [Name],

Jennifer Blake thought she had her pricing figured out. She was wrong by $50,000.

Here's what we discovered in her business audit:
- Hourly rate: $150
- Average project: 20 hours
- Project fee: $3,000

Seems reasonable, right?

But here's what she was missing:
- Scope creep: +5 hours per project (unbilled)
- Admin time: +3 hours per project (unbilled)
- Revision rounds: +4 hours per project (unbilled)

Her ACTUAL hourly rate? $93.

**The Fix That Changed Everything**

We implemented value-based pricing:
- Defined package outcomes (not hours)
- Built in revision limits
- Added rush delivery options
- Created premium tiers

Result: Average project value increased to $5,500. Same work. Better boundaries. 83% more revenue.

This is just ONE insight from a typical Business of One audit. Imagine what we might find in your business...

### Email 2: Implementation Tip
**Subject**: The #1 mistake people make with the toolkit
**Send**: Day 2

Hi [Name],

How's the toolkit working for you?

Here's the #1 mistake I see: Trying to implement everything at once.

**The Better Way:**
Focus on ONE automation this week. Just one.

My recommendation? Start with the Client Onboarding Template (page 12). It typically saves 3 hours per new client.

Here's a quick win from Jennifer who used it last month:
"I onboarded 5 new clients in the time it used to take for 2. Game changer!"

### Email 3: Success Story & CTA
**Subject**: From toolkit to transformation (Sarah's story)
**Send**: Day 5

Hi [Name],

Remember the Time Audit worksheet from your toolkit?

Sarah Chen used it and discovered she was spending 15 hours/week on admin tasks. 15 HOURS!

Here's what happened next:
- Week 1: Implemented 3 automations from the toolkit
- Week 2: Restructured her client process
- Week 3: Launched her new pricing model
- Week 4: Took Fridays off (!)

By month 3? She doubled her revenue working 25% fewer hours.

**The Difference?**

Sarah didn't stop at the toolkit. She got expert guidance to customize everything for her unique business.

That's exactly what I'd love to help you do.
