## Problem Section

### Section Headline
The Solo Business Paradox

### Lead-in
You started your business to have freedom and control. But now you're working more hours than ever, and growth feels impossible without hiring.

### Pain Points

#### 1. Wearing Too Many Hats
**Problem**: You're juggling a dozen roles, none of them getting your full attention.
**Impact**: Critical tasks fall through the cracks, and you're always playing catch-up.

#### 2. No Time for Strategy
**Problem**: You're so busy working IN your business, there's no time to work ON it.
**Impact**: You're stuck in the same revenue range, watching opportunities pass by.

#### 3. DIY Everything
**Problem**: You're trying to master every skill from marketing to tech to finance.
**Impact**: Everything takes 3x longer, and results are inconsistent at best.

#### 4. Scaling Seems Impossible
**Problem**: Growing feels like it requires hiring, but you're not ready for employees.
**Impact**: You're trapped between staying small or taking on overwhelming complexity.
