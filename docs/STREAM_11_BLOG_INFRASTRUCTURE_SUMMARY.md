### 3. Sample Blog Post
Created `content/blog/sample-post.mdx` demonstrating:

### 4. Agent Orchestrator Updates
Updated `scripts/agent-orchestrator.js` to include 8 new blog-related tasks:

## Key Design Decisions

### Technology Stack

- **MDX**: For rich, component-enhanced content
- **Supabase**: For metadata and analytics storage
- **Algolia**: For powerful search functionality

### Content Strategy
- Focus on actionable, practical content for solopreneurs
- 2-3 posts per week publishing schedule
- Mix of content types (guides, case studies, tools)
- Strong emphasis on conversion optimization

### Integration Strategy
- Seamless integration with main Business of One site
- Consistent design system using Utlyze blue (#4169E1)
- Multiple touchpoints for consultation booking
- Email marketing integration for lead nurture

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Orchestrator**: Execute the base tasks first (Next.js setup, design system, etc.)
2. **Deploy Blog Agents**: Once dependencies are met, the blog tasks will become available
3. **Content Creation**: Start creating blog posts following the guidelines
4. **Launch Strategy**: Plan blog launch with initial content batch
