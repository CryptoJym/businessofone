## Implementation Notes

1. **Placeholder Information**: The following items need to be replaced with actual business information:
   - `[Your Phone Number]`
   - `[Your Business Address]`
   - `[Your State/Country]` (in Terms of Service governing law section)

2. **Email Addresses Used**:
   - General legal inquiries: `legal@businessofone.com`
   - Privacy-specific: `privacy@businessofone.com`
   - General info: `info@businessofone.com`

3. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Pages are built with React/Next.js components
   - Tailwind CSS classes used for styling
   - Responsive design implemented
   - The project needs React/Next.js dependencies installed to resolve linter errors

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm init -y
   npm install next react react-dom
   npm install -D @types/react @types/node typescript tailwindcss
   ```

2. **Update Contact Information**: Replace all placeholder text with actual business details

3. **Review and Customize**: 
   - Review appointment terms to ensure they match your business model
   - Adjust cookie list based on actual cookies used
   - Update data retention periods if needed

4. **Legal Review**: Have a legal professional review these documents to ensure they meet your specific jurisdiction's requirements

5. **Integration**:
   - Add links to these pages in your main website footer
   - Implement a cookie consent banner that references the cookie policy
   - Add privacy policy links to all forms that collect data
